# AI Architecture at Insomniac Games

At Insomniac Games, we have our own proprietary engine, and the vast majority of our code is written in C++. We've been using a specific AI architecture in our engine since around 2012. In this section, we'll dive into the details of this architecture and how it has been utilized in our games.

To begin with, let's clarify some terminology. Throughout this section, we'll use the terms "AI" and "bots" interchangeably to refer to the non-player characters (NPCs) controlled by our AI systems.

**Note:** The AI architecture discussed here is specific to Insomniac Games' proprietary engine and may differ from other game engines or frameworks.

## Overview

Our AI architecture follows a hierarchical structure, with a behavior tree at the top level that decides which behavior to run. Behaviors can have an arbitrary number of sub-behaviors, but eventually, a behavior will instantiate a state. These states are the leaf nodes of the hierarchy, and they control animation, motion, and other player-facing actions.

Here's a high-level representation of the architecture:

## Behavior Trees

In our engine, behavior trees serve as the top-level decision-making system for our AI. They determine which behaviors should be executed based on various conditions and rules.

<Callout type="warning">
While behavior trees were initially a prominent part of our AI architecture, we gradually transitioned towards a more data-driven approach in Marvel's Spider-Man, as you'll see in the [Transition to Data-Driven FSMs](/behavior-authoring/transition-to-data-driven-fsms) section.

To illustrate how behavior trees worked in our previous games, let's look at an example from Sunset Overdrive:

This behavior tree excerpt shows a portion responsible for controlling ranged enemy behavior. As you can see, even for a relatively simple subtree, it required a significant number of nodes (34 in this case) to define the desired behavior.

<Steps>

### Step 1
Nodes in the behavior tree often needed to utilize various types of callback functions to handle different scenarios, such as:

- Deciding when a node should run
- Determining if a state should continue running
- Notifying other systems when a state starts or stops
- Handling additional logic not covered by the state itself (e.g., weapon management)

### Step 2
Additionally, the order in which nodes were evaluated (known as the group policy) played a crucial role in ensuring the correct behavior. Our engine supported three types of group policies:

- Priority ranking: Nodes are evaluated in a predefined order of importance.
- Sequence: Nodes are evaluated one after the other in a specific sequence.
- Highest score: The node with the highest score from a decider callback is selected.

</Steps>

While behavior trees allowed us to create complex AI behaviors, they also introduced challenges:

- Trees could become convoluted and difficult to debug as complexity increased.
- Reusability and composability of nodes were often limited due to the need to consider sibling and ancestor node interactions.

As we moved towards developing Marvel's Spider-Man, which featured a significantly larger number of AI classes and variations, we recognized the need to evolve our approach to behavior authoring.
