# Sync Joint

The sync joint is a critical component in Insomniac Games' synced animation system, which was designed to achieve the desired "comic book movie feel" in Marvel's Spider-Man. It serves as the anchor point that ensures precise alignment between the attacker's (host) and the victim's (guest) animations during combat interactions.

The sync joint is a joint on the host character that has a position and orientation that will match the guest character when the synced animations are played back.

The sync joint's primary purpose is to facilitate the seamless synchronization of animations between Spider-Man (the host) and his foes (the guests). This synchronization is crucial for delivering a visually striking and immersive combat experience, where every punch, kick, and web-slinging maneuver feels fluid and connected.

To better understand the role of the sync joint, let's consider an example. Imagine Spider-Man is about to deliver a powerful punch to an enemy. The sync joint on Spider-Man's model is positioned and oriented in such a way that, at the moment of impact, it will align perfectly with a specific point on the enemy's model. This alignment ensures that Spider-Man's punch animation seamlessly transitions into the enemy's reaction animation, creating a cohesive and visually stunning combat sequence.

### Step 1
As Spider-Man's attack animation approaches the impact frame, the sync joint's position and orientation are continuously updated to match the target position on the enemy's model.

### Step 2
At the moment of impact, the sync joint on Spider-Man's model is perfectly aligned with the corresponding point on the enemy's model.

### Step 3
The enemy's reaction animation is triggered, and their model is repositioned and oriented to match the sync joint's position and orientation, creating a seamless transition from Spider-Man's attack animation to the enemy's reaction.

</Steps>

The sync joint concept is not limited to just Spider-Man's attacks; it can also be used for enemies attacking Spider-Man or even for interactions between enemies. The key principle remains the same: the sync joint on the attacker (host) aligns with a specific point on the victim (guest) to ensure fluid transitions between animations.

By utilizing the sync joint, Insomniac Games was able to achieve a level of fidelity and synchronization in their combat animations that contributed significantly to the overall "Marvel feel" of the game. It allowed for seamless blending of mocapped animations, creating a visually stunning and immersive combat experience for players.
