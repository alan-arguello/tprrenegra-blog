# Focus on the Game's Core

One of the key factors that contributed to the success of Marvel's Spider-Man was the team's unwavering focus on nailing the fundamentals that made you truly feel like Spider-Man. This wasn't an accidental achievement; it was the result of a concerted effort to prioritize and get the core elements right, be it the player controls, attack pacing, enemy hit reactions, or even the feeling of using your web shooters.

The best games are often those that excel at capturing the essence of their core experience. In Marvel's Spider-Man, the development team recognized that if they couldn't make you feel like the iconic web-slinger, all the bells and whistles in the world wouldn't matter. So, they dedicated significant time and resources to iterating on the game's fundamental mechanics until they felt just right.

This philosophy manifested itself in various aspects of the game's development, from the combat system to the procedural animation techniques employed. Take, for instance, the [Beat to the Punch System](/combat-iteration/beat-to-the-punch-system), which ensured that Spider-Man would always prevail in situations where he and an enemy attacked simultaneously. This attention to detail reinforced the player's sense of being a formidable superhero, capable of outmaneuvering even the toughest foes.

### Step 1: Identify the Core Experience

The first step in focusing on the game's core is to clearly define what that core experience should be. For Marvel's Spider-Man, it was all about capturing the thrill of being the friendly neighborhood web-slinger. Every design decision, every line of code, and every animation had to contribute to that central goal.

### Step 2: Prioritize and Iterate

Once the core experience was identified, the team had to prioritize their efforts accordingly. They dedicated significant time and resources to iterating on the fundamentals, such as:

- Player controls and movement
- Combat mechanics and pacing
- Enemy behavior and reactions
- Web-slinging and traversal

These elements were refined and polished until they felt just right, even if it meant pushing back other features or content.

The team's commitment to this approach paid off in spades. Players consistently praised the game for its ability to make them feel like they were living out the Spider-Man fantasy. From the fluidity of web-swinging to the satisfying crunch of landing a well-timed punch, every aspect of the experience reinforced the core fantasy.

This attention to detail elevated the combat encounters, making them feel like scenes ripped straight from the pages of a Marvel comic.

Of course, focusing on the core experience doesn't mean neglecting other aspects of the game entirely. It's about striking a balance and ensuring that the peripheral elements complement and enhance the central fantasy, rather than detracting from it.

In the case of Marvel's Spider-Man, the open-world exploration, side missions, and narrative all served to reinforce the core Spider-Man experience. They provided context and motivation for the player's actions, making the game feel like a cohesive, immersive adventure.

By keeping the core experience at the forefront of their development efforts, the team at Insomniac Games created a game that not only resonated with fans of the beloved superhero but also set a new standard for what a great superhero game should feel like.
