# Conclusion

In this presentation, we've explored the AI architecture and development process behind Marvel's Spider-Man, a critically acclaimed game that aimed to deliver an authentic Spider-Man experience. As we wrap up, let's reflect on the key lessons and takeaways from this journey.

## Importance of Iteration

One of the most crucial aspects of game development is the willingness to iterate and refine systems until they meet the desired quality standards. Throughout the development of Marvel's Spider-Man, the AI team at Insomniac Games continuously iterated on various components, including behavior authoring, combat mechanics, positioning algorithms, and animation techniques.

> Iteration is king in game development. We almost never got things right on the first try, and that was okay because we kept pushing to improve our systems.

The examples we've discussed, such as the evolution of combat managers, the refinement of positioning algorithms, and the development of procedural animation techniques, clearly demonstrate the importance of iteration. It's through this iterative process that the team was able to identify and address issues, incorporate feedback, and ultimately deliver a polished and engaging experience.

## Adapting to Fundamental Changes

Game development is a dynamic process, and it's not uncommon for the fundamental nature of a project to shift over time. In the case of Marvel's Spider-Man, the team had to pivot from their previous experience in developing shooters to creating a character action game, which required a fundamental change in their approach and solutions.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Recognize when your problem fundamentally changes, and be prepared to adapt your solutions accordingly. As the team transitioned from developing shooters to a character action game, they had to rethink their approach to behavior authoring, positioning, combat management, and more.

### Step 2
Don't be afraid to embrace new paradigms and techniques when the situation demands it. The team's willingness to move away from complex behavior trees and embrace data-driven hierarchical finite state machines was a crucial shift that enabled them to efficiently handle the large number of AI classes required for Marvel's Spider-Man.

## Focus on the Game's Core

Ultimately, the success of Marvel's Spider-Man can be attributed to the team's unwavering focus on capturing the essence of Spider-Man and ensuring that the game's core mechanics and experiences truly embody the character's abilities and personality.

> **Callout:**
> Marvel's Spider-Man was a success because everyone mentions how the game makes you feel like Spider-Man, and this wasn't an accident. It happened because we took the time to get our fundamentals right.

Whether it was refining the player controls, fine-tuning the attack pacing, perfecting enemy hit reactions, or nailing the feel of using web shooters, the team dedicated significant effort to ensure that these core elements were meticulously crafted. By focusing on the game's core and getting these fundamentals right, the team was able to deliver an experience that resonated with players and critics alike.

As we've seen throughout this presentation, the AI development process for Marvel's Spider-Man was a challenging but rewarding journey, filled with innovative solutions, iterative improvements, and a relentless pursuit of capturing the essence of Spider-Man. By embracing the importance of iteration, adapting to fundamental changes, and maintaining an unwavering focus on the game's core, the team at Insomniac Games has set a remarkable example for the game development community.

Looking ahead, the lessons learned from this project will undoubtedly shape the future of AI development at Insomniac Games and inspire other developers to push the boundaries of what's possible in creating immersive and engaging experiences.
